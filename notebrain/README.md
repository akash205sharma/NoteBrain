###### Problems ######

# Rendering file json Sidebar
1. Sending tree json in props recursively and rendering the TreeRender Component.

# updating and Deleting
2. Props transferred and rendered using recursion 
3. for deleting node from its parent => transefered parent to its child in props.

4.  Deleting Props Not chnage the Actual filetree {
    1. Lifted delete fucntion recursively from every tree Render from parent to child 
    till reaching component appsidebar *with updating the node at every render*
    2. Sent functionLifting2 in treenode as prop
        but use onclick deletefile
        and for upadating at every backtrack used functionLifting2
        functionLifting2 calls => functionLifting which comes from props

    3. made usestate of props in every recursive rendered treeRender component
    for showing effect of deleting the file.
